# MVFNet: Multi-View Fusion Network for Efficient Video Recognition (AAAI 2021)
![1](mvfnet.png)  


## Overview
We release the code of the [MVFNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06977) (Multi-View Fusion Network). The core code to implement the Multi-View Fusion Module is `codes/models/modules/MVF.py`.

**[Mar 24, 2021]**  We has released the code of MVFNet.

**[Dec 20, 2020]**  MVFNet has been accepted by **AAAI 2021**.

## Prerequisites

All dependencies can be installed using pip:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Our experiments run on Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.5. Other versions should work but are not tested.

## Download Pretrained Models

- Download ImageNet pre-trained models

```sh
cd pretrained
sh download_imgnet.sh
```
- Download K400 pre-trained models

## Data Preparation
Please refer to [DATA](./data_process/DATASETS.md) for data preparation.

## Testing

- For 3 crops, 10 clips, the processing of testing

```sh
# Dataset: Kinetics-400
# Architecture: R50_8x8 ACC@1=76.0%
bash scripts/dist_test_recognizer.sh configs/MVFNet/K400/mvf_kinetics400_2d_rgb_r50_dense.py ckpt_path 8 --fcn_testing
```

## Training
This implementation supports multi-gpu, `DistributedDataParallel` training, which is faster and simpler. 

- For example, to train TDN-ResNet50 on Kinetics400 with 8 gpus, you can run:

```sh
bash scripts/dist_train_recognizer.sh configs/MVFNet/K400/mvf_kinetics400_2d_rgb_r50_dense.py 8
```
